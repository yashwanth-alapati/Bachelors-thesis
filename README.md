I worked on this project for Bacehlor's thesis along with two students from SASTRA University-School of Computing.<br>
<br>
Summary of the project:
* Utilize Deep learning techniques to classify leaves into healthy and unhealthy categories.
* Transfer learning methods are used for classification.
* Models are compared based on the following evaluation metrics: precision,recall and accuracy.
* Various models used for classification: RESNET152,Inception V3, EfficientNewB0,DenseNet121 and Proposed model.
* Interactive GUI was built using streamlit.
